maintainer: Midokura SarL
description: |
  This charm will install the midonet java agent.
  All installed agents work as the distributed flow simulator.
  Each agent requires access to the zookeeper and cassandra servers.
  Topology information and host NIC bindings are stored in zookeeper.
  Cassandra can be used as a secondary storage for L4 and NAT state.
