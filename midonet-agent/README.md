Overview
========

This charm will install the midonet java agent. All installed agents
work as the distributed flow simulator. Each agent requires access to
the zookeeper and cassandra servers. Topology information and host NIC 
bindings are stored in zookeeper. Cassandra can be used as a secondary 
storage for L4 and NAT state.
